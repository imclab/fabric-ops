A collection of fabric scripts to make pushing apps to a
small to medium server pool mangeable.

Very much a work in progress and expect many changes to the
structure and layout.

The starting point for this came from some fabric code that
my awesome cow-worker Nathan LaFreniere generated for some
internal AndYet projects.
